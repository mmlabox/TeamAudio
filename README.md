# Team Audio
Team Audio is a sub-team of the Multimodal Box Project (MMBox project). The purpose was to create a system that makes it possible to answer the question "who spoke when?", also called **Speaker Diarization**. To make this possible, two parts were created for the project, the [Client](https://github.com/mmlabox/TeamAudio/tree/main/Client) and the [Server](https://github.com/mmlabox/TeamAudio/tree/main/Server), which play a main role in the audio system.
